          In 2007,Course HUB founders Eren Bali and Oktay Caglar built a
          software for a live virtual classroom while living in Turkey. They saw
          potential in making the product free for everyone, and moved to
          Silicon Valley to found a company two years later. The site was
          launched by Bali, Oktay Caglar and Gagan Biyani in early 2010.In
          February 2010, the founders tried to raise venture capital funding,
          but the idea failed to impress investors and they were rejected 30
          times, according to Gagan Biyani.In response to this, they
          bootstrapped the development of the product and launched Udemy—"The
          Academy of You"—in May 2010. Within a few months, 1,000 instructors
          had created about 2,000 courses, and Udemy had nearly 10,000
          registered users. Based on this favorable market reaction, they
          decided to attempt another round of financing, and raised $1 million
          in venture funding by August. In October 2011, the company raised an
          additional $3 million in Series A funding led by Groupon investors
          Eric Lefkofsky and Brad Keywell, as well as 500 Startups and MHS
          Capital.In December 2012, the company raised $12 million in Series B
          funding led by Insight Venture Partners, as well as Lightbank Capital,
          MHS Capital and Learn Capital, bringing Udemy's total funding to $16
          million. On April 22, 2014, the Wall Street Journal's digital edition
          reported that Dennis Yang, Chief Operating Officer of Udemy was named
          CEO, replacing Eren Bali.In May 2014, Udemy raised another $32 million
          in a Series C funding, led by Norwest Venture Partners, as well as
          Insight Venture Partners and MHS Capital. In June 2015, Udemy raised a
          $65 million Series D financing round, led by Stripes. Now Udemy joined
          another online learning house Skillsdox Inc of Canada to open up
          School of Skills in India. In June 2016, Udemy raised $60 million from
          Naspers Ventures as a follow-up to the $65 million Series D round of
          financing from June 2015.On February 5, 2019, Udemy announced that the
          board of the company appointed Gregg Coccari as its new chief
          executive officer. In February 2020, Udemy raised $50 million from
          long-time partner in Japan, Benesse Holdings, Inc. and announced 2
          billion valuation. In November 2020, Udemy raised $50 million at a
          3.25 billion valuation led by Tencent Holdings.
